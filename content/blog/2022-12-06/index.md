## Steganography

The practice of hiding data inside something else like a physical object or a computer file. There are various ways to create hidden messages using steganography like using secrets inks, lights, musical pitch keys, and different encoding algorithms for digital data. Using these techniques, one may be able to fool even some of the most perceptive analysts.

## Underneath the Mona Lisa

Back in 2015 a french scientist by the name of Pascal Cotte claimed that he uncovered an earlier portrait made by Leonardo da Vinci underneath the Mona Lisa using a multi-spectral imaging technique called Layer Amplification Method (L.A.M.). The English abstract of his paper Lumière on the Mona Lisa - Hidden Portraits (ISBN: 9782954825847) states the following:

> Thanks to an extraordinary scientific imagery technique (L.A.M.), this book takes us on a journey into the heart of the paint-layer of the world’s most famous picture and reveals secrets that have remained hidden for 500 years. Mona Lisa is not actually Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo, but a portrait that masks others. Leonardo da Vinci did not paint one, but four portraits, super-imposed on one another. More than 150 discoveries help us rediscover the painting’s genesis, with Cotte reconstituting the true portrait of Lisa Gherardini – whose face, hairstyle and costume were radically different from those we now see in the Louvre.

Could there be a message hidden in the Mona Lisa?
