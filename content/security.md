## We Take Security Seriously

Security is a high-priority for us and we will always attempt to resolve any critical security issues as quickly as possible. That being said, many of our projects are currently in pre-alpha and as such it should be expected — as with any alpha-quality software — that they contain security flaws. You should take caution when evaluating our projects in security sensitive environments.

## Coordinated Disclosure

Our organization follows [Coordinated Disclosure](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/about-coordinated-disclosure-of-security-vulnerabilities) policies. This means that we will try to actively work with any security reports to achieve a satisfactory resolution. You may forward security inquiries and reports to our [contact](/contact/) email.
