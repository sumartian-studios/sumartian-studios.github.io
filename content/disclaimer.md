## Veracity of Our Statements

**Sumartian Studios is a satirical art project.** We are just doing this for fun and as an experience to experiment with different technologies. You should not take anything we state as "reasonably" fictional as a legally binding claim. For example, when we assert that we come from the future you cannot blame us for making fraudulent claims because anyone with "common sense" would assume the statements to be outside reality.

The purpose of this project is to comically answer the following question: who builds all of the software for those evil fictional organizations in popular movies or films? **We do not produce software for any actual nefarious groups. Our software is not intended to be used for malicious purposes.**

Please use your "common sense" to distinguish between real statements and those which are necessary to progress the fictional narrative we are building at our organization. We cannot be liable for any such misjudgments.

## Unstable Software

Many of our open-source projects are currently in alpha and are considered unstable so you should not be using them anywhere near critical systems. Please remember that you are responsible for any damages incurred while using our software.
