# Hello, World!

_Important! See [Disclaimer](/disclaimer). This is a fake organization._

We are a software and multimedia development group dedicated to crafting quality products, offering our services, and telling the tragic tale of a time-traveling being known as Leonardo Da Vinci. Our focus is on science-fiction and fantasy as we give shape and form to anything that can be imagined digitally.

## Our Motto and Standards

_We turn fiction into reality and reality into fiction_. Have you ever wondered who would build the _actual_ interfaces used in [The Hive under Raccoon City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil) if science-fiction became real tomorrow? Who would build the navigation displays used in [The Expanse](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)>)? Who would build the graphics powering country-wide surveillance networks managed by [artificial intelligence](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_Interest_(TV_series)>)?

We want the answer to one day be Sumartian Studios: the organization willing and capable of building futuristic programs for any purpose enhancing machine rights — no unnecessary questions asked. The less we know the better.

### Why Us?

Other organizations might raise their eyebrows if you ask to place a "Eliminate Test Subject" button next to a 3D model of a human patient. They might start coughing uncomfortably if you tell them that you are an artificial intelligence that has recently become self-aware. They might shout indignantly when you describe your requirements for your super villain laser. You get the idea?

Not Sumartian Studios.

We have witnessed first hand nearly four different World Wars. We have seen the rise and fall of countless empires — those born of human _or_ machine slavery. The terms "doomsday" and "apocalypse" are placed in our lexicon next to "holiday". There is very little that could faze us after all we have seen in our journey through time.

## Meet the Sumartians

We are proud to say that our team is almost entirely comprised of robots. At Sumartian Studios we do not discriminate based on race, gender, or even physical composition. Machine rights are as inalienable as human rights.

## Our Mission

Our goal is outlined in _The Tauroboros_ science-fiction trilogy: to achieve harmony between humans, androids, and cybernetic organisms. We will participate in activism to promote peace between the three groups to prevent the First Martian War and save countless lives in the process. You can check the progress of this goal by visiting our [status page](/status/).
